      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="3284016">&nbsp;</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789370">A business process contains a sequence of steps or activities and each step can perform one or more actions. Moving from one step to another is called a transition and transitions can be conditional based on the results of prior actions. When a business process is running it can open work items to handle human interaction. The business process maintains a set of variables that can change as the steps execute. Variables can be copied into work items to convey information to an approver and copied from work items to assimilate responses from the approver.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789374">Business processes are not normally launched directly like tasks or reports. Instead they are launched as a side effect of some IdentityIQ operation such as editing a role, updating an identity, or the discovery of a policy violation. You cannot schedule a business process through the task or report scheduler, though you can schedule a custom task that launches a business process.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789381">Immediately after launching, the business process engine begins interpreting or executing the business process. The starting step is located and its action is performed, the transitions are evaluated and the next step is located. This process continues until a step is found with an approval action or the end of the process is reached.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789382">When the business process advances to a step containing an approval, work items are created and the business process enters a suspended state. The business process remains suspended until one of the work item owners completes the work item. Completing a work item is normally done by editing it in the IdentityIQ user interface and clicking one of the default completion buttons. Each work item can also control how its information is presented, and can include forms to solicit additional information from the user beyond just an approval or rejection decision.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789387">An approval action can define a sequence of user interactions that are managed automatically by the business process engine. The work related to notifications, reminders, escalation, and sequencing from one approver to another is all handled by the business process engine rather than being modeled as steps in the business process. This provides a concise way to define one of the most common parts of a business process.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789388">When a work item is completed, the business process uses the information from the work item to influence the transitions between steps. The work item also contains a State value which can be Finished, Rejected, Returned, or Expired. This state is used by the business process engine to decide whether to continue advancing through the approval process or to stop and go on to the next step. It might be found that work items previously sent to users are no longer required and they are automatically deleted.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789389">If the approval process continues, more work items might be generated and the business process will again enter a suspended state. Once the approval process terminates, the transitions in the step containing the approval are evaluated and a new step is chosen. The evaluation of steps and transitions continues until another approval is reached or until all of the steps are evaluated and the business process terminates.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789390">One unique aspect of this business process system is that the process can be modified during execution. This is done to adapt to variability in the approval process, such as an unknowable number of approvers, or an unknowable number of phases in an approval sequence. Self-modification can also be used in custom actions to replicate a sequence of steps for an unknowable number of objects. Since a copy of the original business process definition is maintained, modifying it during execution does not effect the persistent definition used when launching it again. Similarly, the original business process definition can be modified at any time without disrupting business processes that are already executing.</a></div>
      <div class="BodyLevel1"><a name="1789397">Creating and editing business processes requires the assignment of administrative capabilities within IdentityIQ.
