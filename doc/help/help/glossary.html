      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622518">The normalized representation of the raw activity data collected from an activity data source such as a Windows Event Log or Syslog. Activity is represented as a java object (ApplicationActivity) and persisted in the database. </a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622523">Activity monitoring</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622527">A means to monitor user activity (raw system log data) for privileged (IT or business) users. </a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622533">IdentityIQ monitors and logs security activity at the operating system, application and database levels and identified security violations are reported to senior management.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622538">Activity search</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622541">Use the Activity Search page to generate searches on activity on specific applications and by specific IdentityIQ identity. These searches can be used to isolate risk areas and track activity on sensitive applications.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622549">Activity Target Category</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622552">Groups of targets from one or more applications. For example, if you have inventory applications at three different locations and a procurement database on each, you can set each procurement database as a target, create a Procurement category, and then collect activity for all three procurement databases using a single activity search.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622557">Additional entitlement</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622560">Additional Entitlements are any entitlements to which the identity has access but that do not comprise a complete role. For example, if a role is comprised of entitlements A, B, and C, but the identity only has access to entitlements A and B, A and B are included in the list of Additional Entitlements. Also, if the identity is assigned entitlements A, B, C, and D, and A, B, and C are grouped as the role, D is added to the Additional Entitlements list.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622565">Aggregation</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622568">Aggregation refers to the discovery and collection of information from the applications configured to work with IdentityIQ. For example, IdentityIQ uses an Identity Aggregation task to pull the values associated with the identity attributes specified during the configuration process from user accounts on the designated applications. That information is then used to create the foundation of the IdentityIQ Identity Cubes. </a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622582">Application</a></div>

      <div class="Term"><a name="1622622">Audit Search</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622625">Use the Audit Search page to generate searches for audit records for specific time periods and for specific actions, sources, and targets. These searches can be used to locate and track events that occur within the IdentityIQ application. The information contained in the audit logs is different then application activity because the event in the audit log are not associated with an application or data source and might not be associated with a specific identity.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622633">Authoritative Application</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622636">The identity authoritative application is the main repository for employee information for your enterprise, for example a human resources application.

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622666">Certification enables you to automate the review and approval of identity access privileges, account group membership and permissions, and role membership and composition. IdentityIQ collects fine-grained access (or entitlement) data and formats the information into reports, which are routed to the appropriate reviewers. Each report is annotated with descriptive business language - highlighting changes, flagging anomalies and calling out violations where they appear.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622673">Identity certifications enable reviewers to approve certifications for identities, or take corrective actions (such as removing entitlements that violate policy).</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622677">Role membership and composition certification enables reviewers to approve the composition of roles - the entitlements and roles that define the role being reviewed, and the identities to which the role is assigned, or take corrective actions.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622681">Account group membership and permission certification enables reviewers to approve the permissions assigned to account groups and the members that make up the group, or take corrective actions. </a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622687">Certification Periods</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622690">Certifications progress through phases as they move through their life-cycle; Active, Challenge, and Revocation. The phases associated with each certification are determined when the certification is scheduled.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><span class="Bold"><a name="1622697">Active</a></span> — the active phase is the review period during which all decision required within this certification should be made. During this phase changes can be made to decisions as frequently as required. You can sign off on a certification in the active stage only if no roles or entitlements were revoked or if the challenge period is not active. When you sign off on a certification it enters either the end phase or the revocation phase. To enter the revocation phase, the revocation period must be active and a revocation decision exist.</div>
      <div class="Definition"><span class="Bold"><a name="1622704">Challenge</a></span> — the challenge phase is the period during which all revocation requests can be challenged by the user from which the role or entitlement is being removed. When the challenge phase begins, a work item and email is sent to each user in the certification affected by a revocation decision. The notifications contain the details of the revocation request and any comments added by the requestor. The affected user has the duration of the challenge period to accept the loss of access or challenge that decision.</div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622711">Email notifications sent to non-IdentityIQ users contain a link to an end user portal which enables them to enter a revocation challenge as if they were logged into the product.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622715">You can sign off on a certification in the challenge phase only if all challenges have been completed and no open decision remain on the certification. When you sign off on a certification it enters either the end phase or the revocation phase. To enter the revocation phase, the revocation period must be active and a revocation decision exist.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><span class="Bold"><a name="1622722">Revocation</a></span> — the revocation phase is the period during which all revocation work should be completed. When the revocation phase is entered, revocation is be done either automatically, if your provisioning provider is configured for automatic revocation, or manually using a work request assigned to a IdentityIQ user with the proper authority on the specified application. The revocation phase is entered when a certification is signed off on or when the active and challenge phases have ended.<br />Revocation activity is monitored to ensure that inappropriate access to roles and entitlements is revoked in a timely manner. Revocation completion status is update at an interval specified during the deployment of IdentityIQ. By default this is performed daily. Click <span class="Bold">Details</span> to see view detailed revocation information in the revocation report.</div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622736">Certification Search</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622739">Use the Certification Search page to generate searches on certifications within your enterprise. These searches can be used to isolate specific certification risk areas and track the progress through their life-cycle.</a></div>

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622791">Connectors provide the means by which IdentityIQ communicates with targeted platforms, applications and systems. Connectors are Java classes that implement the IdentityIQ </a><span class="Italic">Connector</span> interface.</div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622804">There are two types of connector in IdentityIQ, application-type connectors that collect account information, and activity-type connectors that collect activity information. IdentityIQ uses the information from both types to maintain the identity cubes.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622812">Correlation</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622815">Correlation refers to the process of correlating, or combining, all of the information discovered by IdentityIQ (identity attributes, entitlements, activity, policy violations, history, certification status, etc.) to create and maintain the IdentityIQ Identity Cubes. Correlation does not involve accessing external application to discover information. Correlation reviews the information contained within the IdentityIQ application and updates identity cubes as necessary.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622829">Correlation Key</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622835">The attributes that IdentityIQ can use to correlate activity discovered in the activity logs for this application with information stored in identity cubes.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622836">For example, activity logs might contain the full name of users instead of unique account ids. Therefore, correlation between the activity discovered by an activity scan and the identity cube of the user that performed the action must key off of the user’s full name.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622841">Data Source</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622847">An instance of a configured IdentityIQ activity collector.

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622881">The Forward function is used to forward a certification request to a different IdentityIQ user with certification authority. When you forward a certification it is removed from your Certification page and does not show up on your risk score statistics. Owner history and all comments are maintained with forwarded work items on the View Work Item page.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622887">Group</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1647367">Groups are used to track accessibility, activity, and monitored risk by group membership. Risk scores are displayed on the Dashboard. Groups are defined automatically by values assigned to identity attributes or by account group membership. Account groups are based on common entitlement within an application, not common qualities as defined within IdentityIQ.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622902">Group Factory</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622905">The Group Factory defines groups automatically by values assigned to identity attributes such as Department, Location, Manager and Organization.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1622910">Hierarchical role model</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1622913">In role based access control, the role hierarchy defines an inheritance relationship among roles. For example, the role structure for a bank may treat all employees as members of the 'employee' role. Above this may be roles 'department manager' and 'accountant,' which inherit all permissions of the 'employee' role</a></div>

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623162">Use revocation to request the removal of an identities access to a specified role or entitlement. No action is taken on a revocation request until the certification containing the request is completed and sign off on. This is done to ensure that no entitlement is removed until final confirmation has been received from the requestor. </a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623166">Entitlements that are assigned to more than one role are not revoked with the role. For example, if role A is made up of entitlements X, Y and Z, and role B is made up of entitlements W and X, revoking role A only revokes entitlements Y and Z. </a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623173">IdentityIQ can automatically revoke the specified access if automated revocation is configured for your provisioning provider.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623177">Revoked entitlements continue to be listed with the identity until the next Account Aggregation type task is run on the application with which they are associated.

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623205">A role is a collection of other roles or entitlements that enable an identity to perform certain operations within your enterprise. For example, one role might enable the request of purchase orders and another might enable the approval of purchase requests. IdentityIQ uses roles to monitor these entitlements, identify separation of duty policy violations, and compile identity risk scores to enable you to maintain compliance. </a></div>

      <div class="Definition"><span class="Bold"><a name="1623277">1.</a></span></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623283">Custom rules are created during the configuration process and are used by IdentityIQ to handle correlation, notification, escalation and IdentityIQ identity creation.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623290">Correlation rules are used to define the identity attribute to use when correlating accounts discovered during an application aggregation with identities that exist in IdentityIQ. For example you might want to set the correlating attribute as email address or first and last name.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623298">Notification rules are used to define the identity that is notified when policy violations are detected.</a></div>

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623305">Identity creation rules are used to set attributes on new Identity objects when they are created. New identities may be created during the aggregation of application accounts, or optionally created after pass-through authentication. One common operation is to change the name property of the identity when the default application name is complex (such as a directory DN). Another common operation is to assign a set of initial capabilities based on the attributes pulled from the application account.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><span class="Bold"><a name="1623313">2.</a></span></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623319">Rules are used to enforce your separation of duties policies by identifying IdentityIQ identities that have been assigned conflicting roles. For example, a rule might be defined that disallows a single IdentityIQ identity from having roles that enable them to both request and approve purchase orders.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623326">Violations on each of a policy’s rules, when detected, are stored in the offending identity cube. These violations also appear on identity score cards and enable you to identify high-risk employees and act accordingly.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1623331">Scope</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623335">A scope is a container within the product in which objects can be placed to restrict access.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623338">Controlled Scope — a scope over which an identity has access. This is combined with the identity's capabilities to determine to which objects a user has access. Every identity in the system can control zero or more scopes. </a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623339">Assigned Scope — a scope in which an object lives and is used to control who can view and manage the object. Every object in the product is assigned zero or one scopes. By default, an object that does not have an assigned scope is available to everyone. The default behavior can be changed during configuration.</a></div>
      <div class="Term"><a name="1623344">Self-service</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623347">Software that allows users to request access to resources using a self-service interface, which uses workflow to route the request to the appropriate manager(s) for approval.</a></div>

      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623355">Subordinate certifications are any certifications that must be completed before the top-level certification can be completed. Examples of subordinate certifications are any groups of identities that you reassign, or any lower-level, subordinate, manager certifications.</a></div>
      <div class="Definition"><a name="1623359">Subordinate certifications are not displayed as part of the identities list and do not reflect as part of the completion status for this certification. All subordinate certifications that require completion (manager/subordinate manager certifications) or reassigned certifications must be in a complete state before the certification can be signed off on.</a></div>
